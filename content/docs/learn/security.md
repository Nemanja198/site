    How is my data stored in Dashbird?
  </span>

Dashbird imports logs from your AWS CloudWatch API and stores them in a <u>dedicated</u> and <u>encrypted</u> bucket in S3. After that, logs are aggregated and analyzed into data metrics, which are then stored in a <u>secure database</u> hosted on AWS.
