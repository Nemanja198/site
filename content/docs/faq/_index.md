    1. How to set up Dashbird?
  </span>
</h2>
Setting up Dashbird takes under 5 minutes and requires no code changes.

To start, [sign up](/signup) and follow the on-screen instructions to link your AWS account with Dashbird.

Full instructions can be found [here](/docs/user-guide/get-started).

    2. Is there any overhead?
  </span>
</h2>
**Dashbird does <u>not</u> affect the performance of your Lambda functions.**

Dashbird gets all of the information from logs when they reach AWS CloudWatch, meaning that the service has no effect on the execution itself.


<h2>
  <span class="h2 underlined bold">
    3. Is there added cost for my AWS bill?
  </span>
</h2>
**There is <u>almost no added cost</u> to your AWS bill.**

AWS prices Data-transfer out of CloudWatch equivalently to Data-transfer from EC2.

The first GB of the month is free, with every GB after that $0.09.

    7. Can I choose which Lambda Functions get monitored?
  </span>
</h2>
**Yes!**

You can control our log importer by specifying filters.
<br>Navigate to _**Menu -> Importer settings**_
![Lambda filtering](/images/docs/filtering.png 'Lambda filtering')

Filters are <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)' target='_blank'>glob patterns</a>.

Use <code>some-service-*</code> to include and <code>!some-service-prod-*</code> to exclude lambda functions. You can also use the `name includes` or `name excludes` to filter functions.

By default, all Lambda Functions are imported to Dashbird.

Read more from [here](/docs/settings/configuring-dashbird/).
