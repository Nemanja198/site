You can connect multiple AWS accounts to your Dashbird account. This will allow you to track your Lambda functions across multiple accounts.

<h2>
  <span class="h2 underlined bold">Setting up</span>
</h2>

To start, click on your organization on the top right corner, and choose `Add new organization`. The rest of the onboarding process is the same as the <a href='/docs/user-guide/get-started/'>initial onboarding</a>.

<h2>
  <span class="h2 underlined bold">User management</span>
</h2>

Users are managed per connected AWS account. This means that if you connect another AWS account, you must re-invite users to that account as well.

<h2>
  <span class="h2 underlined bold">Pricing</span>
</h2>
Dashbird's pricing is per AWS account. In certain situations, we offer discounts to multiple account setups.
