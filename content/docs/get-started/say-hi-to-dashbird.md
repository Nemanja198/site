# Lambda function filtering
1. Navigate to [clients page](https://app.dashbird.io/clients).
![](/images/docs/settings.png)

2. By default, all lambdas are imported (*)

3. Add one or more filters to select the right subset of lambda functions.
Filters are [glob patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)), meaning you can specify which lambdas you want to import by matching a string and a wildcard(*).
For instance, filter `*-prod-*` matches all function names like 'service-prod-functionName'

_Note that you can test any filter before adding with the 'Test' button._

4. *Click Save!*

5. The next import will only import the functions specified in the list.

# Multiple AWS Accounts

You can connect multiple AWS accounts to your Dashbird account. This will allow you to track your Lambda functions across multiple accounts.

<h2>
  <span class="h2 underlined bold">Setting up</span>
</h2>

To start, click on your organization on the top right corner, and choose `Add new organization`. The rest of the onboarding process is the same as the <a href='/docs/user-guide/get-started/'>initial onboarding</a>.

<h2>
  <span class="h2 underlined bold">User management</span>
</h2>

Users are managed per connected AWS account. This means that if you connect another AWS account, you must re-invite users to that account as well.

<h2>
  <span class="h2 underlined bold">Pricing</span>
</h2>
Dashbird's pricing is per AWS account. In certain situations, we offer discounts to multiple account setups.
